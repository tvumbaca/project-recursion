#Project: Recursion

From The Odin Project: http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/recursion

##Warmup: Fibonacci

Two methods that accept a number argument and return that many members of the fibonacci sequence.
\#fibs uses iteration, #fibs_rec uses recursion. 


##Project: Merge Sort

Build a \#merge_sort method that accepts an array of unordered numbers and returns a sorted array using recursion.
